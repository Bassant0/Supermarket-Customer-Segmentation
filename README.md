## About the Project

Using detailed customer data from a supermarket, this project:
- Analyzes various features, such as `Age`, `Income`, `Occupation`, etc.
- Employs clustering techniques (`K-means` & `K-medoids`) to segment customers.
- Provides actionable insights to maximize ROI and enhance the shopping experience.

## Data Exploration

From boxplots capturing `Age` & `Income` intricacies to categorical feature analysis, the project thoroughly investigates underlying patterns.

## Data Preprocessing

Data cleaning steps include:
- Handling outliers
- Feature scaling
- Categorical data encoding

## Modeling

Using `K-means` & `K-medoids` algorithms, the project segments customers effectively. A Silhouette Score of **0.6** underscores the precision of these segments.

## Results

Visualization tools, like t-SNE and PCA, are used to visualize the high-dimensional clustered data in a 2D space.
